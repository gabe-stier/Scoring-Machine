If any issues arise, you can read the code and attempt to fix the issue yourself or contact Gabe Stier, thismachine's code will be hosted on a private repo.
Created by Gabe Stier <gabezter4@yahoo.com>, if you wish to getin touch email me. I will be more than willing to help fix any issues that could arise or create any new
